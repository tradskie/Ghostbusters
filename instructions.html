                <h4><u>The Contract</u></h4>
                </br>
                <p>The contract is open source and visible here on <a href="https://ftmscan.com/address/0x13b511bc21a05087b3297818f3ac3bf0b9039907#code" target="_blank"><u>FTMScan</u></a>. Just as with all of "<a href="https://t.me/TheRealDeveloper" target="_blank"><u>The Developers</u></a>" projects, the contract is rug free and immutable, meaning there are no functions that the dev can use to drain or change the contract operations. The probability of the FTM Miner contract draining is highly unlikely due to our tested and proven strategy.
                </p>
                </br>
                <h4><u>Strategies & Additional Information:</u></h4>
                </br>
                <p>FTM Miner is for users who want long term profits and sustainability. It is not for people who want instant profits that ultimately Rekt others.</p>
                
                <p>FTM Miner is not to be confused with farms. Miners are not bought, they're hired and therefore can not be sold. Once miners are hired they work for you indefinitely, providing you with an unlimited amount of FTM at a starting rate of 8% daily.</p>

                <p>Our algorithm allows every participant to profit handsomely, no mater their strategy but it will not allow any single participant to have an unfair advantage over other participants. It's truly a beautiful thing!</p>
                
                <p>While the FTM Miner algorithm makes sure that all participants receive their fair share of rewards, it also favors it's most supportive participants through it's compounding option AKA "Hire More Miners".</p>

                <p>We HIGHLY recommend the strategy on compounding 6 day/week and harvest 1day/week,  you either strictly compound AKA "Hire More Miners", strictly pocket FTM or you do a healthy combination of both. In our opinion the best strategy is to compound as often as profitable, considering transaction gas. Once you're happy with your daily, weekly or monthly results, take profits as often as you see fit and simply continue compounding the rest.</p>

                 <p>Keep in mind that the 8% is not completely constant, it will vary slightly based on a combination of factors, including your personal hiring, pocketing, compounding habits and the habits of the community as a whole. Your personal habits hold much more weight in regards to your overal personal returns. Also remember, just as that number can decrease it also increases based on a combination of those same habits.</p>

                 <p>After hiring any number of miners, you will begin to see returns very close to the advertised 8% daily, this number will rise and/or fall based on the factors explained above. We will not attempt to share any exact numbers because it's a little too complicated but IOHO it's one of the most beautiful and fair systems available in the cryptocurrency space. FTM Miner is complete and 100% automated DeFi, no developer interaction is necessary to continue operating as intended.</p>
                 </br>
                 <h4><u>How To Mine FTM With FTM Miner</u></h4>
                </br>
                <p>Hire Miners > Miners Find FTM > Compound > Withdraw > Profit!</p>
                </br>
                <p>Step 1. Hire Miners using FTM.
                </p><p>Step 2. Your miners will start digging, placing the FTM they find into your barrel. You can compound AKA "Hire More Miners" using the FTM in your barrel to increases your FTM mining production rate.
                </p><p>Step 3. Alternatively, you can pocket the FTM in your barrel and your miners will begin filling your barrel again.
                </p>
                <p>Miners will continue filling your barrel with FTM non stop. A 24hr timer has been added for your convience, no need to have loose FTM sitting around too long doing nothing. You can "Hire More Miners" or pocket your FTM at any time but it's recommended to do so at least once every 24 hours.</p>
                </br>
                <h4><u>Fees:</u></h4>
                </br>
                <p>The only fee that users personally incur is their transaction gas fees. A 5% development fee is paid to the developer but this fee is not paid by you as a user,  this fee is paid to the developer by the contract as a whole.</p>
